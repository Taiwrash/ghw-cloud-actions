# User Guide

This tool allows you to fetch and display information about a GitHub user and their most popular repository.

## Steps to Use the Tool

1. Open the tool in your web browser.
2. You will see a form asking for a GitHub username. Enter the username of the user you want to fetch information for.
3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. The tool will fetch and display the following information:
    - The user's username
    - The user's location
    - The user's most popular repository (the one with the most stars)

## Troubleshooting

If the tool is not working as expected, check the following:

- Make sure you entered the username correctly. Usernames are case-sensitive.
- Make sure the user has public repositories. The tool can't fetch information about private repositories.
- Check the console for any error messages. These can give you clues about what's going wrong.
